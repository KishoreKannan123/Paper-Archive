# Research Paper Archive

## Contents 
*(Add the links for each paper here)*

- [Dummy Paper 1](./)

------

This will be a community-driven repository where people contribute by sharing their thoughts on different research papers they have come across as a simple readme file. This would benefit the contributors by acting as a documentation for future reference and once this archive becomes decently big it would benefit the larger community as a whole. There is no restriction regarding what papers you can add onto this archive - can be old, new anything. Hope this repository gets some good contributions. Happy reading :)

**To contribute** 
- Fork the repository
- Add the required files as described below.
- Make a pull request (everything will be merged)
