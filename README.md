# Research Paper Archive

PS. There are some issues with the math getting rendered in Github's dark mode. We're working on it, but until then we request you to switch to lite mode/open the summary in incognito(which defaults to light mode) to view the paper if you face any difficulty in viewing the math!!

This will be a community-driven repository where people contribute by sharing their thoughts on different research papers they have come across as a simple readme file. This would benefit the contributors by acting as a documentation for future reference and once this archive becomes decently big it would benefit the larger community as a whole. There is no restriction regarding what papers you can add onto this archive - can be old, new anything. Hope this repository gets some good contributions. Happy reading :)

### Current Paper Count: 30

### NOTE

- Please ensure that you create an entry point to the summary on the main README FILE (this one).
- Create seperate folders for each paper to add to the repository and keep a seperate folder inside each called assets for any images used in your summary. 
- In case of any error in any of the summaries, feel free to open an issue stating the paper name and what you think is the problem with the summary!!
